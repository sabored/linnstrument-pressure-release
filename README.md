#  MICROLINN 

Unfinished, still a few more features to add, plus a few features don't quite work right yet. Use at your own risk.

The  LinnStrument is an amazing instrument, very feature-rich. If it's new to you, we *strongly* reccommend waiting to install microLinn until after you've explored all the standard features.

For experienced linnstrumentalists, microLinn makes exploring microtonality very easy. Load up your usual MPE synths, set the notes per octave, and play! It's that simple! All the microtonal retuning is done by the LinnStrument and nothing needs to be done to your synths.


#  INSTALLATION  


1) Go to https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/support/support-linnstrument-update-software and follow the "How to Check Your Software Version" instructions. If it's not 2.3.3 or 2.3.4, follow the "How to Update Your LinnStrument Software‍" instructions to update to 2.3.4. Linux users: use a friend's mac or Windows machine to update.
2) Download linnstrument-firmware-microLinn-234.072.001.ino.bin.zip from the LinnWIki (the LinnStrument Community wiki) and unzip it. Important: if on a mac, put the .bin file on your **desktop**. 
3) Follow the "How to Update Your LinnStrument Software‍" instructions, with one difference: after you download and unzip the updater and before running it, put it in the same folder as the .bin file from step 2. Mac users: when you run the updater, if it asks for permission to read files from the desktop, say yes.
If you accidentally long-press the Update OS button, you'll enter user firmware mode and the display will go blank. To return to normal, just unplug your LinnStrument.
If you see "Couldn't retrieve LinnStrument's settings, interrupting firmware upgrade. Go ahead with default settings?", **STOP**, because "go ahead" means "delete all user settings and calibration data". Quit the updater app, unplug the LinnStrument and start over.
4) Check your OS version to confirm the update. Tap twice to see all three numbers. It should be 234.072.001 or higher. If not, reboot your computer and try again. 
5) Important, read the next section about uninstalling!


#  UPDATING / UNINSTALLING  


IMPORTANT: Updating to a newer version of microLinn is done normally. Put the new .bin file next to the updater app, etc. But if you want to go back to an official (non-microtonal) version of the firmware, there's an extra step. Just before you run the updater, on the Global Settings screen, tap (don't long-press) the "Update OS" pad *twice* so that it turns red. This tells your LinnStrument to *uninstall* microLinn. This deletes all your microtonal data, necessary in order to avoid deleting your calibration data and all your user settings.

Don't uninstall when updating to a newer version of microLinn, because you'll needlessly delete your microtonal data.

*Details: if you're a programmer using the Arduino IDE to flash the firmware or to display debugging data on the serial monitor, it doesn't matter if the Update OS pad is blue or red.*

# IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY

Slide: a large bend to a new pad, as opposed to a small bend that stays within one pad.

Consistent sliding: when you slide to a note and then play it again without sliding, the bent pitch matches the unbent pitch.

Mismatched bend ranges: deliberately mismatching the ranges of your LinnStrument and your synth. Causes inconsistent slides.

Bend slope: The bend slope is normally 1 semitone per pad, which is about 6¢/mm. Mismatched bend ranges change the bend slope.


#  NON-MICROTONAL FEATURES


COLUMN OFFSETS

Ranges from 1 (OFF) to 10. For negative offsets, use the hidden lefthanded setting in Global Settings column 1. The usual LinnStrument tuning is row offset +5 and column offset +1, or (+5 +1). Each of the three most popular hexagonal-key layouts can be translated to the LinnStrument's square keys in two ways:
* Bosanquet or Janko layout translates to (-1 +2) or (+1 +2)
* Wicki-Hayden layout translates to (+5 +2) or (+7 +2)
* Harmonic Table layout translates to (+4 +3) or (+7 +3)

The column offset can be set for each split independently. You can have one of these six layouts on the left for easy chord playing (probably with pitch bending off) and the usual layout on the right for easy melody playing, somewhat analogous to an accordion's layout. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

You can set both column offsets at once by linking them. In the upper right there are two split buttons. Hold the right one and tap the left one. You'll be switched to the left split, and the left offset will change to match the right offset. Both split buttons remain lit up, and any change affects both offsets. To unlink them, tap either split button. 

----->  All microLinn per-split settings can be linked this way.  <------

When you power up your LinnStrument, if the two offsets are identical and are not OFF, microLinn automatically links them.

----->  All microLinn per-split settings are auto-linked this way.  <------

  *Details: Beware, if the column offset is 2 and the row offset is an even number, you lose half the notes and only get a whole-tone scale. In general, the column offset and the row offset should not have any common factors. If they do, both offsets will be displayed in red.*

  *Playing melodies with pitch bending can be tricky. An offset of +2 changes the bend slope from 6¢/mm to 12¢/mm, +3 makes it 18¢/mm, etc.  Thus to play in tune with a large column offset you may need both Pitch/X Quantize and Pitch/X Quantize Hold to be on. (But if your column offset is +2, setting Quantize on and Quantize Hold off lets you play the skipped notes fairly accurately by sliding into the gap between pads. In fact, you can easily play 24edo quartertones on a normal 12edo LinnStrument this way.)*

  *You can also use mismatched bend ranges. With a column offset of +2, set your LinnStrument's range to twice your synth's range. Now the bend slope is the usual 1 semitone/pad. Bends are easier to control, but slides are inconsistent. So this method works best when only small bends are used.*

  *In the Octave/Transpose screen, "Transpose Lights" tranposes by columns not semitones. If your column offset is +2, transposing the lights by 1 shifts everything over 1 column, changing the pitch of each pad by 2 semitones.*

PER-SPLIT ROW OFFSETS

Setting the row offset for a split overrides the Global Settings row offset for that split only. This is indicated by turning the Global Settings pad pink when that split is active. The per-split row offset ranges from -25 to +25, plus OFF and No Overlap which appears as NOVR. To get a positive/negative row offset, tap the blue button in the upper left. A No Overlap split can be used to launch audio or midi clips while you play normally in the other split. Such a split can have its own custom light pattern, see below. See also Mini Clip Launcher below. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  *Details: The No Overlap row offset equals the physical width of the split, even if column offset is on. Once an edo is chosen, each pad no longer has a unique midi note. To use a No Overlap split as a clip launcher, use Tuning Table mode, which does supply unique midi notes.*

CONDENSE TO SCALE

Make the unlit pads go away! Bending still works. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  *Details: Condensing uses various microtonal features (see below). Set the edo to 12 and select one of the 7 microtonal scales. If your scale is all one color (e.g. the 12edo major scale is all white notes), fix that in the note lights screen. Adjust the color of one or more notes with the rainbow editor, or simply turn off the rainbow enabler to use the usual 2 colors.*

  *In the Per-split Microtonal Settings menu, change Condense To Scale from OFF to VAR, which stands for variable bend slope. Slides are consistent. When traversing a minor 2nd the bend slope is the usual 6¢/mm, but over a major 2nd it doubles to 12¢/mm. The bend slope changes sharply at the center of the pad.*

  *This variable bend slope causes certain issues. (1) It makes vibrato on certain notes lopsided. For example, a normal vibrato on C of a C major scale will tend to be wider when sharpening and narrower when flattening, making the C note sound slightly sharp. So you might want to do a slightly off-center vibrato, going closer to B than to D. (2) When sliding slowly at a steady speed through a large interval, you may notice the bending becoming faster and slower. So you might want to slide through minor 2nds faster than major 2nds.*

  *If you rarely do large bends, you might prefer a constant bend slope. This avoids lopsided vibrato. You can set the slope to a specific number of semitones per pad, ranging from 1 to whatever the largest step is. For example, the largest step in a 12edo major scale is 2 semitones, so you can swipe Condense To Scale past VAR to either 1 or 2. You can still do large bends, but they can be tricky. If you choose 1 semitone, overshoot and bend by ear. If you choose 2 semitones, set QUANTIZE HOLD off and you can slide into the gap between pads to reach all the notes of the scale.*

  *When condensing is on, changing scales in the Global Settings display automatically updates the playing surface. The bend slope won't be updated. This gives you more freedom. For example, you can choose a pentatonic scale, set the bend slope to 3 (the largest step size), and switch back to a diatonic scale.*

  *You can also experiment with changing the pitch bend range on the LinnStrument to the number of notes in your scale, or some multiple of that. For a 7 note scale, change 12 to 7, 24 to 14, etc. Leave your synth set to 12 or 24, so that the bend ranges don't match. With Condense To Scale set to 1, this makes your actual bend slope 1.7 semitones per pad = 10¢/mm. This is good for very large bends, because the octaves are easy to slide to.*

  *If you turn off pitch bending (thus avoiding all these issues), there's no difference between VAR, 1, and 2.*

  *To have unlit pads in a condensed scale, in the rainbow editor, turn the color off. See microtonal Note Lights below.*

Condensing can be combined with column offsets. First the scale is condensed, then columns are omitted. Setting the column offset to 2 omits every other column, setting it to 3 omits 2 out of 3 columns, etc.

There's a school of thought that says there's only 12 notes, it's not that hard to learn your way around, and removing 5 of the 12 notes doesn't make the scale all that much more compact. So is it really worth condensing if it causes bending issues? If playing microtonally, condensing a large edo to a smaller scale can be very useful. For example, you can condense a 31edo chain-of-5ths scale of 12 notes to get quarter-comma meantone, the dominant tuning in Western music for 200 years. Or condense 53edo to the 22 shrutis of Indian music, or to a 12-note subset of that. But even in 12edo, condensing has its uses. For example, you can create a vertical Wicki-Hayden layout. (Playing vertically means rotating the LinnStrument 90 degrees.) The range is huge, almost 8 octaves on a LinnStrument 128! See below for details.

MONO MODE

In OneChannel and ChannelPerRow modes, one midi channel can have mutiple midi notes. The LinnStrument's default behavior when this happens is designed for compatibility with non-MPE polyphonic synths. For example, when more than one pad is played, slides are quantized to the nearest semitone. Mono mode adds 2 new behaviors that are designed for compatibility with non-MPE *monophonic* synths. 

  PITCH/X FIXES: 
  * Selecting "X" or "X+Z" allows unquantized slides.
  * You can trill on a single note by using a pad on another row that plays the same note.
  * When the latest-played pad is released, the most recent bend for the new latest-played pad is sent, so you can trill while sliding.

  MAXIMIZE LOUDNESS/Z: The LinnStrument's default behavior is to send Z data from the latest note only. By necessity, a pad's Z data must start and end with a zero value. Thus holding one pad and playing a 2nd pad causes an abrupt jump in loudness to 0, and releasing that pad causes an abrupt jump from 0 to the Z-value of the 1st pad. Selecting "Z" or "X+Z" maximizes the Z data via a "soft takeover" as opposed to a "hard takeover". Z data is sent only from whichever pad is currently being pressed the hardest.

  *Details: Set your LinnStrument to OneChannel or ChannelPerRow and set Mono Mode to X+Z. Don't use poly pressure for LOUDNESS/Z. Set your synth to mono and to either retrigger or single-trigger. Don't use MPE. Set the non-MPE bend range to match the LinnStrument. (to do: add pic of Surge XT's non-MPE bend range) Set the note priority to latest. If you never play non-MPE synths polyphonically, you can leave mono mode permanently set to X+Z.*

  *Thanks to KVR forum member teknico for the maximize-Z code! See https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=591770.*

HAMMER-ONS AND PULL-OFFS

Just like a guitar, except you can hammer-on to either the right or the left, or both (highest, lowest or latest priority). Hammer-ons happen with any nearby pad on the same row. Works well with Z-maximizing. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  *Details: Set the hammer-on zone to perhaps 2 semitones. Play two notes 1 or 2 pads apart on the same row. The later note will mute the earlier note. When you release it, a pull-off retriggers (unmutes) the earlier note, using the later note's note-off velocity. So lift your finger off quickly for a loud pull-off, slowly for a soft one.*

  *If you want to play 2 notes a 2nd apart simultaneously, play them on 2 different rows. Or, slide to the first note from outside the zone before hammering. Or, set the wait time to perhaps 100ms. This prevents a note from being hammered on until it has been held for that long. Now you can play a simultaneous 2nd on one row by playing both notes at once.*

  *What happens when you play 3 or more notes within the zone and release one of them? Releasing a muted note doesn't do anything. In Right+Left mode, releasing the latest note (the sounding note) retriggers the latest muted note. But in Right-only or Left-only modes, it's the nearest muted note.*

  *The zone size ranges from 1 to 12 semitones, plus ALL which includes the entire row. After choosing an edo, you can set the zone size in tenths of a semitone, 0.1 to 12.0 plus ALL.*

  *Hammer-ons require ChanPerNote or ChanPerRow mode. The note-on that sounds the hammer-on note is sent immediately after the note-off that mutes the earlier note. (The opposite is true during a OneChan trill in "X" or "X+Z" mode, to allow single-trigger).*

LOW ROW XYZ JOYSTICK MODE

Joystick mode lets you shape your sound as you're playing, much as the Touche SE from Expressive E would, or the Lightpad Block from Roli. Control 3 to 5 additional CCs at once by rolling your fingertip within a single pad on the low row. Joystick mode is actually WXYZ, because a 6th CC, the W CC, is optionally sent when you first touch the low row. That CC's value is the velocity of that initial touch.

All CCs are reset to 0 or 64 upon releasing the low row, unless you latch the CCs via a 2nd touch anywhere in the low row. Latching lets you play the new sound with both hands. The low row turns color to indicate the latching. Once the low row is completely untouched, the next touch un-latches.

  *Details: On Per-Split Settings, long-press the Low Row XYZ pad. Swipe past HLD (hold) and FDR (fader) to JOY (joystick). JOY is like HLD, but it reduces the range of X from 7 pads to 1, and moves the zero point from the center of the pad to the left edge. Swiping down past X, Y and Z reveals the W, X' and Y' CCs which default to OFF. Setting X' to a CC moves the zero point back to the center of the pad. Roll to the right to send the X CC, and roll to the left to send the X' CC. The Y' CC works similarly, roll up for Y and down for Y'.*

  *Swipe down below X' and Y' to find "W=0". This indicates that the W CC resets to 0 when the low row is untouched and unlatched. Swipe right to change it to "W=64" for reset-to-center.  Below "W=0" is "X=0" and "Y=0", which work similarly. (X', Y' and Z always reset to 0.) X=64 makes the most sense when X'=OFF, because the reset value will correspond to the center of the pad, analogous to a physical joystick. Likewise Y=64 works well with Y'=OFF. X=64 and Y=64 also apply to the HLD mode.*

  *See CC SUGGESTIONS below for which CCs to avoid. X and X' can be set to match, e.g. both CC16. Likewise the Y and Y' CCs can match. But no other low row CCs should match. Otherwise a single touch will send two values for one CC, and the CC value will jump wildly. As always, if any CC is sent by the low row and also by normal play via TIMBRE/Y or LOUDNESS/Z, the low row takes priority. Thus touching or latching the low row temporarily stops normal play from sending that CC.*

  *You might want to use a low row pad with a braille dot, to feel the center of the pad.*

DRUM PAD MODE

The note lights become 14 mega-pads that play the 14 drum sounds from the sequencer. Not for stick drumming! Good for tabla/dumbek-style finger drumming because you can roll on one note with two or three fingers. Rolls can be legato, good for cymbals. The mega-pads can be either 2x3 or 3x3. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  *Details:*
  * *Set PITCH/X on, otherwise a tap that hits two pads will send two notes. The drum sounds won't be accidentally pitch-bent because drum pad mode filters out all pitch bends.*
  * *You can use the low row for pitch bending, restriking, etc.*
  * *If using 3x3 mega-pads on the LinnStrument 128, you only get 10 mega-pads.*
  * *The midi mode should usually be OneChannel. (You could possibly use ChannelPerRow to make the 3 rows of each pad sound slightly different, for example high hat closed tightly/loosely)*
  * *The sequencer can have different drum sounds for each split. If you're using both splits, set the split point in between the pads.*
  * *The two pad colors are the main/accent colors of the current split. If you select a custom light pattern, it will overlay the drum pads. Useful for making the center of each 3x3 mega-pad a different color.*
  * *If you use musical sounds instead of drum sounds, and enter the appropriate pitches into the sequencer, you can make a sort of marimba.*
  * *To create your own mega-pad layout, turn off Drum Pad mode, use locating CCs instead (see below) and edit one of the custom light patterns to match.*

CHAINING SEQUENCES

Hold the pad for sequence #2 and tap the pad for sequence #1. Now the two sequences are chained into a single sequence twice as long. This is indicated by sequence #1 being accented and sequence #2 blinking. You can chain #3 and #4 together as well. Or chain all 4 together. The lights for the entire chain will blink when it's playing. When making a chain, to start at the beginning of the chain not the end, hold the last sequence and tap the first one. 

You can select sequences and chains on the fly as the sequencer is playing. You can also chain and unchain on the fly. Straight/dotted/triplet/swing and quarter/8th/16th are still set individually for each sequence, so a chain can mix these together. To clear all chains in a split, tap the hidden switch immediately to the left of the 4 selector pads. Or just unplug the LinnStrument.

SEQUENCER PEDALS

When playing in one split and using the other split as a sequencer, it's no longer necessary to switch to the other split before using the following footpedals (or switches or midi NRPN messages): PLAY, PREV, NEXT and MUTE. 

  *Details: From outside of a chain, the NEXT and PREV footswitches take you to the next/previous sequence as before. You can double-tap or triple-tap the NEXT and PREV footswitches to skip forward/backward multiple sequences. Thus triple-tapping NEXT is the same as single-tapping PREV, which means you only need one footswitch to go anywhere.*

  *But from within a chain, NEXT and PREV operate relative to the upcoming sequence in the chain, not the current one. Thus pressing PREV repeats the current sequence and pressing NEXT goes forward two sequences, not one. One exception: from the rightmost sequence of a chain, NEXT exits the chain. (Otherwise you could never exit.)*

FOOTSWITCH / PANEL SWITCH: IMPROVE PCH (pitch)

"PCH" used to simply toggle the PITCH/X pad on and off. Now it swaps the current PITCH/X, Quantize and Quantize Hold settings with the previous settings. You can switch back and forth between any two settings in the PITCH/X column, e.g. Quantize Hold fast vs. slow.

  *Details: Set the pads in the PITCH/X column as desired. Pressing PCH for the very first time turns off all the pads. Change this all-off setting to something new. Press PCH again to return to your old settings. Press again to go to your new settings.*
  
  *PCH affects the active split only, unless Both Splits is selected and both splits are visible. PCH also controls the hidden setting Pitch Reset On Release. Both the current and previous settings are stored in the 6 memories. If the PCH switch seems to stop working, check that you aren't simply switching between two identical settings. As before, long-pressing PCH makes it momentary (non-latching). As before, the panel switch light helps you keep track of which setting is in use.*

PRESET DISPLAY: PROGRAM CHANGE AND BANK SELECT

To send a Bank Select message instead of a Program Change message, hold the blue dot in the lower left corner and swipe (or tap the green/red buttons) as usual. When swiping, both Bank Select and PC messages are sent only on touch release. This avoids a single swipe sending multiple messages and overwhelming your synth. See https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=570851.

NEW FOOTSWITCH / PANEL SWITCH FUNCTIONS:

  AUTO-OCTAVE: To select, hold Octave Up and tap Octave Down, or vice versa. Playing an arpeggio upwards while this switch is on automatically transposes you up an octave. Downward arpeggios transpose down. (Secret undocumented feature in the official firmware.)

  OCTAVE UP/DOWN: 8VE± toggles between Octave Up and normal. This lets you switch octaves while playing using only one footswitch, instead of two for Octave Up and Octave Down. 8VE∓ toggles between Octave Down and normal. Added onto any settings in the Octave/Transpose display. 

  PREVIOUS PRESET/BANK: PRE returns you to the previous preset and bank. This lets you quickly change your sound while soloing with only one footswitch, instead of two for PR+ and PR-. It also lets you access non-adjacent presets with a single press. When setting the previous and current presets, use a single swipe, not multiple taps.

  PREVIOUS MEMORY: MEM returns you to the previously loaded (not imported) memory. Always applies to both splits. Beware, loading a memory changes what the footswitch does. So to toggle back and forth between memories, you must set the footswitch to MEM in *both* memories.

  PREVIOUS SCALE: SCL returns you to the previous scale (aka note lights). Always applies to both splits. Works with condensed scales to alter the tuning on the fly.

DETUNING

Detune the entire LinnStrument up or down from A-440 to match a similarly detuned recording or instrument. No guarantee that detuning to A-432 will heal your chakras lol. Accessed through microLinn's anchor cents after setting the edo to 12.

MISCELLANEOUS GRAPHICS IMPROVEMENTS

  DOUBLE VOLUME FADERS: The Volume display now has two horizontal faders, one for each split. Touch rows 1-3 for the left split, rows 6-8 for the right split, or rows 4-5 for both. Incidentally, the volume faders are and always have been more accurate than their appearance suggests. Move sideways within a pad for fine adjustments. They also do and always have done something similar to hammer-ons and pull-offs.

  The obvious use is to balance the volume of your two splits. But you can use a splitter on your computer's stereo headphones output to send one audio channel to your amp and the other to an earbud that you use as an in-ear monitor. You can control the volume of both from the Volume screen. Good for noisy gigs, good for chaotic jam sessions where you need to discretely find the key or the chords.

  *Details: In your DAW, send the synth's output to two tracks, each hard-panned to opposite sides. Each track receives the LinnStrument's midi from one of the 2 main midi channels (usually 1 and 16). Each track has a gain effect which you midi-learn to the volume CC. Now one volume fader will control your amp and the other will control your earbud.*

  CC FADERS USE TWO COLORS: When a split is set to SPECIAL = CC FADERS, the 8 faders always alternate between the main and accent colors, making it much easier to locate the right fader. Incidentally, the CC faders are and always have been more accurate than their appearance suggests. Move sideways within a pad for fine adjustments. They also do and always have done something similar to hammer-ons and pull-offs.

  NEW COLOR: Violet. Also, the colors now cycle in rainbow order WRPOYLGCBVM.

  MULTI-COLORED NOTE LIGHTS: Each of the 12 notes can be any color. Transposable. Accessed through the microLinn menu after setting the edo to 12.

  SHOW A CUSTOM LIGHT PATTERN IN ONE SPLIT ONLY: Choose any of the 3 patterns (the scales marked A, A# and B) and it will replace the note lights. If you use one split as a clip launcher, you can color-code your clips. You can display different light patterns in each split. You can have fretboard patterns for each split, in different colors so that you can see the split point. Choosing A', A#' or B' displays the note lights as well, on top of the light pattern. This lets you for example set the note lights to show just the tonic and overlay that onto the fretboard. Incidentally, this feature fixes a bug in which a custom light pattern would cover up a split set to CC FADERS or STRUM. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  DIM MODE: Normally, Low Power mode (Global Settings column 15) dims the display but also increases the latency. You can optionally dim the display without adding latency. It's in effect a crude brightness knob. It's good for when all the pads are lit up, like condensed scales or certain microtonal displays. 

  *Details: Tapping the Low Power pad now cycles through 3 options: normal (unlit), dim-and-slow (dark blue) and dim-and-fast (light blue). When Update OS is on (serial mode), dim-and-slow is not allowed.*

  BLINKING MODE: Like the SAME mode, BLNK shows you other occurences of the currently played note. But instead of changing color, the other occurences blink. It's good for multi-colored displays like custom light pattern #2 (the one marked as A#) or certain microtonal displays. 

  *Details: In Per-split Settings, long-press the PLAYED color. The BLNK option appears right after CELL and SAME. Don't confuse BLNK for blinking with BLIN for blinders.*

  SAME/BLINK CARRY OVER: If both splits are set to SAME or BLNK, playing in one split optionally shows matching notes in the other split too. Accessed through the microLinn menu.

  WARNING FOR A DOUBLY-USED MIDI CHANNEL: If a channel is used by both splits, in the Per-Split display it's shown in red.

LOCATING CCs

A locating CC message can be sent immediately before every note-on, indicating the row and column. Accessed through the microLinn menu.
* Send each row to a different synth while in ChanPerNote mode, giving each row full MPE polyphony.
* Or use this feature plus a custom light pattern to create large drum pads for more easily playing drum midi. 
* Or code in your DAW can assign a specific function to a specific pad:
* * upper lefthand corner is All Sound Off
* * lower righthand corner has bass notes that act as keyswitches
* * each pad in the leftmost column is a specific Bank Select message
* Or create a third split, perhaps a column of on/off buttons, or a vertical fader or two, or even a horizontal split. 

On an actual guitar, middle-C played on the 2nd string 1st fret sounds very different when played on the 6th string 20th fret. Many guitar VSTis allow you to set the playing position (higher or lower on the fretboard) through keyswitches. Depending on your VSTi, it may be possible for code in your DAW to translate a locating CC to such a keyswitch and thus directly map the LinnStrument's columns to the virtual guitar's frets, making the guitar sound much more realistic. (It may also be possible to do this without locating CCs simply by using Channel Per Row mode.)

  *Details: Locating CCs are mainly for ChannelPerNote mode. In OneChannel mode the locating CC can locate a note-on but it can't locate the subsequent XYZ data. In ChannelPerRow mode, the channel serves to locate the note. But locating via CCs has two advantages over locating via ChannelPerRow. One, ChannelPerRow forces you to give up full MPE, because two notes on the same row can't be bent independently. Two, locating by CC is unaffected by transposition, col/row offsets, etc. thus one can assign a function to a specific pad, like the upper left one.*

  *One type of CC is sent for note-ons in cols 1-16 and another type of CC is sent for note-ons in cols 17-25. The two types are selected in the microLinn menu. (On a LinnStrument 128, the 2nd type is never sent, and the menu option for it is hidden.) The two types should be different. If they are the same, they will be displayed in red. See CC SUGGESTIONS below for which CCs to avoid.*

  *For cols 1-16, the CC's data value is (row - 1) + 8 * (col - 1). For cols 17-25, the data value is (row - 1) + 8 * (col - 17). Row 1 is the top row and column 1 is the leftmost column. The CC is sent on the same channel as the note-on. Assuming the default 235 microseconds between USB MIDI bytes, sending locating CCs delays note-ons by only 705 microseconds.*

  *Reaper users: download microLinnLocatingCCs.jsfx from the LinnWiki. It defines a rectangular region on the LinnStrument, within which it can either transpose each note to a specific note (good for drum pads) or transform it into a CC message in a variety of ways. It can also filter out other midi either inside or outside of this region. Example uses:*
  * *Download microLinnLocatingCCsHorizontalSplits.RPP to create 2 horizontal splits.*
  * *Download microLinnLocatingCCsFilterByRow.RPP for one synth per row while in ChanPerNote mode.* 
  * *Download microLinnLocatingCCsDrumPad.RPP and import microLinnLocatingCCsDrumPadLightPattern.mid for a custom drum pad layout.*
  
  *Non-Reaper users: if your DAW isn't programmable, you may still be able to run microLinnLocatingCCs.jsfx. It runs natively in Reaper and can run in any Windows DAW using ReaJS, a free jsfx-to-VST wrapper. (Hopefully someone can duplicate this effect in Abelton's Max 4 Live, FL Studio's MIDI scripts, Logic's Scripter, Bitwig's Grid, StreamByter (free macOS/iOS AU plugin) and other platforms.)*
    
  *Thanks to KVR forum member vorp40 for the locating CC idea!*

IMPORTING/EXPORTING

You can back up various settings and/or share them with others via midi files. The 6 memories, the 3 custom light patterns, the 16 audience messages, the 16 sequencer projects, microtonal data, and all settings combined. A memory or light pattern imports in about 1 second, doable on stage in between songs. You can use the clip launcher (see below) to trigger an import on stage, giving you dozens of memories, one for each song on the set list! Check the LinnWiki for export-request files and importable settings files.

  *Details: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ABLETON LIVE, because of the use of multiple midi channels. Try using Geert Bevin's receivemidi and sendmidi apps (https://github.com/gbevin) to handle the data. It should be possible to create 2 max4live devices that would translate the data to/from a format that doesn't use midi channels. A single polypressure message would become two CC messages. If you're interested in making such devices, contact Kite.*

  *To import, download a settings file from the wiki. On your LinnStrument, set Allow Importing to IMP. In your DAW, set the output of a midi track to your LinnStrument. Load the settings file into that track and press play. Your LinnStrument should scroll "IMPORT SUCCESS". To stop the scrolling, tap anywhere. If you see "IMPORT FAILURE", try again. If you don't see anything, see troubleshooting #9 below.*

  *To import a custom light pattern, before you press play, you must first display the one you want to overwrite. To import an audience message, before you press play, you must first load for editing the one you want to overwrite. (You needn't actually edit it.)*

  *If the EDO is OFF, ScalesCurrentEDO imports/exports the 9 scales in the Global Settings display. If the EDO is on, it imports/exports the 7 scales in the Microtonal Note Ligts display.*

  *AllSettingsCurrentEDO imports/exports not only the scales, rainbow and fretboard, but also the equave semitones, the equave cents, the guitar tuning, and all row and column offsets. It does not import/export the anchor pad, note or cents.*
  
  *Exporting: Download an export-request file from the wiki. In your DAW, set the input of midi track A and the output of midi track B to your LinnStrument. Put the export-request midi file at the start of track B. Then start recording on track A. When your LinnStrument stops sending midi, stop recording. Save the midi on track A to a midi file (i.e. export it from your DAW), preferably as format 0. Name it something informative such as "lightPattern31edoFretboard.mid" or "22edoScales.mid". Later on you can import this file to restore your settings. Or share it on the wiki.*

  *A single NRPN will import/export one setting. You can create your own NRPN files by editing a copy of an export request file and changing the last number in the 3rd and 4th messages. You can change multiple settings with a midi file containing multiple NRPNs. For an example of this, see below setCCfadersTo21-28.mid for clip launching. Bulk exports consist of a single NRPN followed by multiple polypressure messages. A midi file can contain multiple NRPNs and/or multiple bulk exports. See https://github.com/TallKite/linnstrument-firmware/blob/main/midi.md for the details.*

  *Exporting multiple requests: 1st method: Record each export individually. Then position those midi clips next to each other in your DAW, and save them all as one file. 2nd method: Send the first request and see in your DAW where the LinnStrument stops sending midi. Position the next request file in track B about 1/10 of a second after that. Position additional request files similarly. Record all requests at once, and save the midi to a file as before.*

  *Troubleshooting:*
  * *(1) While importing or exporting, don't play your LinnStrument.*
  * *(2) To import, in your DAW, your LinnStrument must be enabled as a midi output device (not just input).*
  * *(3) Your DAW must be able to handle a midi file that uses multiple midi channels.*
  * *(4) For security, unplugging the LinnStrument turns Allow Importing off, so you must turn it on each time you import.*
  * *(5) When importing, first exit all web browsers in case a webmidi page sends rouge NRPN or polypressure messages.*
  * *(6) When importing, slowing down your DAW's playback speed sometimes helps. Likewise, when exporting, speeding up your DAW's recording speed can help.*
  * *(7) The AllUserSettings export is meant for migrating from an old LinnStrument to a new one. It can import from a Linn128 to a Linn200 and vice versa. But it will only import if the OS version on the old LinnStrument matches the OS version on the new one. (Or more precisely, if the data structure versions match. The current version is 72.2, which can also import from 72.1.)*
  * *(8) If you get "IMPORT FAILURE" followed by 2 numbers, the 2nd number says which midi message in the import file caused the failure. For example, 7 means the 7th midi message.*
  * *(9) MicroLinn imports data via polyphonic pressure messages. If you have connected something else to your LinnStrument that also sends polypressure messages, there is a small possibility of confusion. If after importing there is no sucess or failure scrolling message, to avoid confusion either set Allow Importing to OFF, or just unplug the LinnStrument.*

  *Bulk importing or exporting all 16 sequencer projects always overwrites the current project. Therefore export it before exporting the 16 projects, and import it after importing the 16 projects. Or use the updater app as usual to make lpr files, which doesn't overwrite anything.*

Export request files available on the LinnWiki:

* 1-requestCurrentLightPattern.mid (current means the currently-displayed light pattern)
* 2-requestAllLightPatterns.mid

MINI CLIP-LAUNCHER

(For a full-sized clip launcher, see Per-Split Row Offsets above for setting up a split that launches clips using note-ons not CCs.)

The Preset display has 16 new buttons that use the 16 CCs from the Per-Split Special mode CC Faders. Tapping a button sends a simple on/off pair of CC messages to your DAW. Whereas the faders are for precise control, these new buttons are for launching a midi or audio clip. They give quick access to all 16 CCs at once and don't require a dedicated split.

Besides the obvious musical usages such as playing backing tracks, your DAW can send a midi clip back to the LinnStrument that imports settings. This lets you avoid lengthy menu-diving and swiping while on stage.

Importing lets you access more than 6 memories and more than 3 light patterns. A launching button can bulk import a single memory or all 6 memories. One button can even do multiple bulk imports. You can import multiple settings after loading a memory, allowing combo setups e.g. memory A plus import B plus import C. (This is why the launching buttons are next to the 6 memory buttons.) For example, the 6 memories might correspond to various synths, the first 4 launching buttons might assign various functions to the left foot pedal, the next 4 likewise for the right foot pedal, and the last 8 CCs might be used as faders in the right split.

  *Details: the upper 8 buttons on the Preset display send the left split's fader CCs on channel 1, and the lower 8 send the right split's fader CCs on channel 16. You can send a left-split CC while in the right split and vice versa. The most-recently tapped button is accented.*

  *Be sure to set Allow Importing to IMP. When bulk importing, instead of scrolling "IMPORT SUCCESS", all 200 pads briefly flash green. This makes multiple imports quicker. Always wait for one bulk import to end before starting another.*

  *To make a midi clip that imports various settings, first set up your LinnStrument manually. Then send it one or more NRPN-299s. Record the midi that the LinnStrument sends in response.*

  *The CC types default to 1-8 for both splits. Beware, CC1 is also sent by the low row and CC7 is also sent by the Volume display. We wouldn't want to accidentally launch a clip when we adjust the volume, or vice versa! Better to use one set of CCs to control your synths and another set of CCs to control your DAW. A good choice for the latter is CCs 21-28 (see CC SUGGESTIONS below). To select these CCs, long-press the CC Faders button and swipe. Or download setFaderCCsTo21-28.mid from the LinnWiki and import it into your LinnStrument. If you want to use only one split's CCs for launching, import setLeftFaderCCsTo21-28.mid or setRightFaderCCsTo21-28.mid. To undo, import setFaderCCsTo1-8.mid.* 

  *Beware: loading a memory (or importing one) overwrites the launcher/fader CC choices. If your DAW responds to CCs 21-28 and the newly-loaded memory uses fader CCs 1-8, the launching buttons stop working. So immediately after loading/importing an older memory, import setFaderCCsTo21-28.mid and save/export the updated memory.*

  *Each launching button sends a CC with value 127 when touched and 0 when released. There are other ways to send these CCs. For example, a CC Faders split 1 column wide acts as a toggle: when touched it sends a value alternating between 0 and 127, and when released it sends nothing. Thus to launch a clip via a CC Faders split you must double-tap. (Best to double-tap from on to off to on, so that the identifying colors are shown.) A clip can also be launched via a panel switch or footswitch set to Sustain or CC65, long-press the Sustain or CC65 pad to set the CC.*

  *To set up Reaper to launch midi clips:*
  * *In Reaper options/preferences/midiInputs, enable your LinnStrument's input for control messages*
  * *Download clipLaunchingActions.ReaperKeyMap (or clipLaunchingActionsLeft or clipLaunchingActionsRight)*
  * *Import it via Menu/Actions/ShowActionList/KeyMap (all sections) to create 16 (or 8) custom actions triggered by CCs 21-28*
  * *Either set the CCs on your LinnStrument to 21-28, or else edit the shortcuts of the custom actions*
  * *Download clipLauncher.rpp from the LinnWiki, open it, and put a midi clip (or clips) on each track*
  * *If you're using clips to import settings, set the midi hardware send of the relevant tracks to your LinnStrument.*
  * *Open your usual performance Reaper project in a new tab and move clipLauncher.rpp to the last tab*
  * *Tapping the launching buttons will launch the clips in tracks 1-16 of the last tab's project*
  * *You can create clipLauncher2.rpp loaded with different clips and use it instead by simply moving it to the last tab*
  * *To temporarily disable clip launching, download blank.rpp from the LinnWiki and move it to the last tab*

  *Reaper users can create a custom action that toggles a setting on/off when using a footswitch or a CC fader one column wide. Edit the custom action, remove all "skip" lines and replace the "set solo" line with these 4 lines (17 and 18 are arbitrary examples):*
  * *Action: Skip next action if CC parameter <= 0/mid*
  * *Track: set solo for track 17*
  * *Action: Skip next action if CC parameter > 0/mid*
  * *Track: set solo for track 18*
  *Do the same for the "select track" line. Then put your "on" clips in track 17 and your "off" clips on track 18.*

CC SUGGESTIONS

  * Low row joystick: W=CC15 or OFF, X=CC16, Y=CC17, Z=CC18, X'=CC19 or CC16 or OFF, Y'=CC20 or CC17 or OFF
  * Clip launching: CCs 21-28
  * Locating: CC29 and CC30 (LinnStrument 128: CC29 only)
  * Grouping: CC31 for both splits
  
  *Avoid locating or grouping with these CCs that the LinnStrument uses for other purposes, which will be displayed in red:*

  * *CC 0 = bank select (when swiping in the Preset display)*
  * *CC 1 = mod wheel (when Timbre/Y = CC1 or Low Row = X)*
  * *CC 7 = volume (when swiping in the Volume display)*
  * *CC 1-8 (when Special = CC Faders)*
  * *CC 11 = expression (when Loudness/Z = CC11)* 
  * *CC 16-18 = general purpose (when Low Row = XYZ)* 
  * *CC 64 = sustain (when Low Row = Sustain or Assign Switch = Sustain)*
  * *CC 65 = portamento (when Assign Switch = CC65)*
  * *CC 74 = brightness (when Timbre/Y = CC74)*

  *If any of these pads (CC1, X, CC Faders, etc.) are light blue, a hidden setting may be allowing the use of another CC beyond these. Also beware of the very powerful channel mode messages (CCs 120-127). Only use them if your DAW reliably intercepts every single such CC before it can reach your synth.*

SET THE NOTE LIGHTS REMOTELY VIA MIDI -- NOW 3X FASTER

MicroLinn duplicates the effect on the LinnStrument of CCs 20-22 with either CC25 (cols 1-16) or CC26 (cols 17-25). CC25's data value is (row - 1) + 8 * (col - 1). CC26's data value is (row - 1) + 8 * (col - 17). Row 1 is the top row and column 1 is the leftmost column. The color is encoded in the midi channel (1 = red, 2 = yellow, etc.). Unlike CCs 20-22, you needn't be in the performance display or editing a custom light pattern for the CCs to take effect.

DISABLE MAIN MIDI CHANNEL VIA NRPN

Disable it by sending NRPN 1 or 101 with a value of 0. Must be in ChannelPerNote or ChannelPerRow mode. Using NRPN 299 to read the main midi channel reports a disabled main channel as channel 0. See https://github.com/TallKite/linnstrument-firmware/blob/main/midi.md and https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8322723#p8322723.

SET ARPEGGIATOR TO QUARTER-NOTE TEMPO VIA NRPN

Send NRPN 236 with a value of 0. See https://github.com/TallKite/linnstrument-firmware/blob/main/midi.md and https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6809095#p6809095. Can also be done via low row by sliding all the way to the left.

MANY NEW NRPN MESSAGES

See https://github.com/TallKite/linnstrument-firmware/blob/main/midi.md.

MISC SMALL BUG FIXES

* Respond to midi input on the main channel when in ChanPerNote or ChanPerRow mode
* If the DAW resets CCs 98-101, RPN/NRPN handling is unaffected
* Receiving CC1 used to always move the 1st fader, CC2 moved the 2nd fader, etc. even when the faders were not linked to CCs 1-8. Faders now respond to the proper CC. But CC6 and CC38 can move a fader only if they're not part of an RPN or an NRPN.


#  MICROTONAL FEATURES  


EDOS

The edo (stands for Equal Division of an Octave, the notes per octave) ranges from 5edo to 55edo, plus "OFF" which makes the LinnStrument run normally. Change the edo by swiping sideways. You don't need to do anything to your MPE synth to make it microtonal because all the microtonal fine-tuning is done via pitch bends. True "plug-and-play" microtonality!

  *Details: When PITCH/X is off, the LinnStrument outputs standard midi notes (60 = middle-C, 69 = A-440, etc.) with "tuning bends". For example, in 24edo half the notes will have a 50¢ tuning bend. When PITCH/X is on, any "played bends" are automatically added on to the tuning bend. (As always, large bend ranges create a slight inaccuracy. A bend range of 96 semitones rounds all bends to the nearest 9600/8192 = 1.17¢.) See also Tuning Table mode below, which uses non-standard midi notes without tuning bends.*

MicroLinn can be set to 12edo. MicroLinn's 12edo has a few advantages over the standard, non-microLinn 12edo.
* It can be stretched and/or detuned
* It can be condensed to the scale notes
* You can have multi-colored note lights

FINE-TUNING, TRANSPOSING AND STRETCHING

The actual pitches of each pad are set via the anchor pad and the anchor note, and are fine-tuned by the anchor cents.

  *Details: The anchor pad is a specific pad that doesn't change pitch when you change the edo. The anchor pad chooser displays the row and column of the current anchor pad. For example, "R4C11" (or "4 11" on the LinnStrument 128) means row 4 (from the top) and column 11. Tap the blue "R4C11" anywhere and you'll see the normal display with the anchor pad blinking. Tap any pad to set it as the new anchor pad. This pad beomes the new tonic, and all the note lights will shift accordingly.*

  *Changing the anchor pad shifts the note lights much like Transpose Lights does, only you can shift by rows as well as columns. Changing the anchor note transposes by 12edo semitones. Changing the anchor cents detunes the entire LinnStrument. Like the guitar tuning screen, a midi note is sent when you change either one.* 

Besides transposing via the anchor note, each split can be transposed by edosteps via the Octave/Transpose screen. 

  *Details: When the notes per octave is greater than 12, the Octave/Transpose screen has 4 rows.*
  * *The top row transposes by octaves as usual*
  * *The 2nd row transposes by major 2nds*
  * *The 3rd row transposes by edosteps*
  * *The bottom row shifts the lights sideways as usual, i.e. transposes by columns*
  *A major 2nd is defined as the interval between the 4th and the 5th, e.g. 3 edosteps for 15edo but only 2 edosteps for 16edo.*

It's possible to stretch the octave or even create non-octave scales like Bohlen-Pierce. 

  *Details: The octave is really the equave, the interval of equivalence. It's defined as twelve 12edo semitones plus zero cents. Redefine it by swiping on Equave Semitones (5 to 36) and/or Equave Stretch (-60 to 60).*

CYCLING THROUGH THE EDOS - DEFAULT LAYOUT

Once microLinn is on (i.e. once an edo is chosen), you can cycle thru the edos by setting a panel switch or footswitch to EDO+ or EDO- (long-press TAP TEMPO and swipe). Changing the edo automatically adjusts all row offsets so that their size in cents stays roughly the same. So your fourths tuning will remain fourths, your fifths tuning will remain fifths, and your standard guitar tuning will remain standard. If either column offset is not OFF, it will get adjusted as well. Furthermore, you can set the default layout for either split to be Bosanquet etc. and your layout will become (and remain) Bosanquet. 

  *Details: A default layout is stored in the per-split row/col offsets, so it overrides the Global row offset. Bosanquet = A1/M2, Bosanquet 2 = m2/M2, Accordion = m3/M2, Wicki-Hayden = P4/M2, Wicki-Hayden 2 = P5/M2. Array Mbira 1 = P4/P5, Array Mbira 2 = P8/P5. But this may vary in certain edos, to ensure coprime row/col offsets. For example, 24edo Bosanquet is not 10/4 but 5/4. See also Guitar Tuning below.*

SUGGESTIONS FOR EXPLORING EDOS

* The first few edos are pretty strange, so you may want to start with 19 or 22 (or possibly 15 or 17). Or 24 for middle eastern music.
* For nice-sounding chords, try the Bosanquet layout for 31edo (memory #4) and the Kite guitar layout for 41edo (memory #5)
* To avoid a touched pad turning red (or whatever) and obscuring the pad's usual color, set the played color to blank
* If the full rainbow scale seems overwhelming, try setting the played mode to blinking (BLNK)
* Once you know an edo and its layout well, you might want to switch to the fretboard dots display

GUITAR TUNING

MicroLinn's guitar tuning is completely independent of the usual one. Changing one doesn't change the other. MicroLinn's guitar tuning screen doesn't set the pitch of each "string". Instead it sets 7 independent row offsets. 

  *Details: On the far left, there are 8 green buttons, one for each string. The "anchor string" is the row that the anchor pad is on. Its pitch is determined solely by the anchor pad, note and cents. The anchor string has a double button. Tap any button to select a string. The button turns light blue and sounds that open string. Assuming it's not the anchor string, one of the neighboring buttons, whichever one is closest to the anchor, turns dark blue. You won't see a note name with an octave number as before. Instead you'll see a row offset as a number, which can be negative. This is the interval between the two blue strings. Swipe right or left on it as before to increase or decrease it.*

  *Changing one row offset doesn't affect the other six row offsets. Thus increasing any row offset above the anchor string sharpens the current string and all strings above it. And increasing any row offset below the anchor string _flattens_ the current string and all strings below it. To summarize, you're _seeing_ the offset between the two blue strings, but _hearing_ the pitch of the light blue string only.*

  *If any of the 8 side buttons or 7 offsets is red, that means it's not coprime with one or both of the two column offsets.*

A guitar tuning is a standard tuning if the intervals between open strings are all 4ths, except for that one major 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd rows. The exact notes don't matter, just the intervals. If you switch edos while in a standard tuning, you'll stay in a standard tuning. 

  *Details: When in a standard tuning, on the Global Settings screen the GUITAR pad is dark blue, otherwise it's bright blue (or possibly pink or red). The edo's 4th is defined as its closest approximation to 4/3. The edo's major 3rd is defined as two octaves minus four 4ths. Thus 22edo's major 3rd is 8\22 = 436¢ not 7\22 = 382¢. This ensures a double octave from the 6th string to the 1st string. There's two possible 4ths for 13edo (5\13 and 6\13) and 18edo (7\18 and 8\18). Either 4th keeps the GUITAR pad dark blue.*

  *In Global Settings, when you long-press the OCTAVE pad, the "-GUI" option for reversed guitar tuning is not available when microLinn is on. To get this reversed tuning, set the guitar tuning manually.*

Guitar tunings can be condensed either diatonically or chromatically.

  *Details: Condensing usually affects the row offsets as well as the column offsets. It makes the row offsets an inconsistent number of edosteps but a consistent number of scale steps. For exampe if condensing a 12edo major scale with a +4 row offset, the row offsets will be sometimes 3 semitones, sometimes 4, but always a third. However, if condensing a guitar tuning, this is not always true.*

  *In the guitar tuning display, when you select the anchor string, a row offset is not displayed. Usually nothing is displayed. But when condensing is on, you'll see DIA for diatonic/condensed. Swipe right to get CHRO for chromatic/uncondensed. In diatonic mode, the row offsets are condensed as usual. But in chromatic mode, the row offsets don't get condensed, and the notes in the anchor column don't change. Each row is an exact chromatic transposition of the anchor row. Thus while the anchor row has no unlit pads, the other rows usually do.*

NOTE LIGHTS

The 9 scales in Global Settings columns 2-4 are now microtonal and change for each edo. The 3 custom light patterns work as usual.

  *Details: You can still select a scale using columns 2-4, but you can no longer edit a scale there, because for larger edos there are too many notes to fit into the 3x4 box. As a result, when microLinn is on, the VIEW MAIN and VIEW ACCENT buttons do not work, and the SCALE SELECT button is always on. To edit a scale and its colors, instead go to the microLinn menu and go to the note lights screen. Shortcut: you can long-press the scale's pad in Global Settings columns 2-4 to go directly to that scale.*

  *The note lights screen has 7 scale buttons plus the rainbow editor, the fretboard selector and the yellow rainbow-enabler button. Excluding the rainbow enabler, there are 9 buttons, corresponding to the 9 scales in Global Settings cols 2-4. Tap any of these 9 buttons to select it. Tap any already-selected button to backtrack to the previous button. You can repeatedly tap a button to quickly switch back and forth between two scales. Alternating between the scale you're setting up and the rainbow editor is particularly handy.*

  *There are 7 rows of colored lights on the screen. From top to bottom they are for unisons, 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths and 7ths. Tap a note in a scale to toggle it on or off. Like the guitar tuning screen, a midi note is sent when you tap.*
  
  *The 8th scale is the rainbow editor. Tap a note to cycle it thru the rainbow. You can turn a note's color off. The advantage of this is that a condensed scale can have unlit pads. The disadvantage is that it makes toggling a note on or off in the 7 scales more confusing. You have to rely on the sound to know if a note is selected. So unless you're using condensed scales, avoid turning off the note's color.*
  
  *The 9th scale (guitar-like fretboard dots) isn't really a scale. It's a full-screen display like the custom light patterns. Tapping the fretboard selector makes the dots appear in dark blue mid-screen. Tapping the dots will toggle them on or off. The fretboard automatically repeats at the octave, so in 12edo, changing the 1st column affects the 13th column, changing the 2nd affects the 14th, etc.*
  
  *Long-press the scale buttons or the rainbow editor button or the fretboard selector button to reset the note lights to the default. Tap the yellow rainbow enabler button to turn off the rainbow and limit the note lights to the usual two colors.*

  *Default colors: There are usually 7 white notes, corresponding to CDEFGAB. In a bosanquet layout, they are grouped CDE and FGAB. There are usually 5 yellow sharps and 5 green flats. Thus F# is always yellow and Bb is always green. Large edos have double sharps/flats, or even triple or quadruple.*

             for most edos                 for perfect (7 14 21 28 35) or pentatonic (5 10 15 20 25 30) edos
              white = natural              white = natural, pink = tonic = anchor pad plus its octave-mates
              green = b                    green = down
             yellow = #                   yellow = up
               cyan = bb                    cyan = dud (double down)
             orange = ## = x              orange = dup (double up)
               blue = bbb                   blue = trup/trud (triple up/down)
               pink = x#
             purple = bbbb
             violet = xx
                red = bbbbb
    orangish-yellow = xx#

  * *In perfect edos (7, 14, 21, 28 and 35) and pentatonic edos (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) the tonic is pink, to help it stand out*
  * *In pentatonic edos and in supersharp edos (8, 13 and 18), there are only 5 natural (white/pink) notes*
  * *In superflat edos, green Bb is higher in pitch than white B*
  * *Yellow is officially called lime, and orangish-yellow is officially called yellow*

  *Default scales: 3 of the 7 scales are blank but for the tonic, so that you can create your own scales on the note lights screen. The other 4 are MOS scales. They are chosen somewhat arbitrarily from many possibilities. The L/s ratio is generally at most 2:1. They use the brightest (sharpest) mode that includes the 5th.*

  *The 12edo scales are an exception. Had they been chosen similarly, they would have been minor pentatonic, whole tone, lydian, whole step/half-step diminished octotonic and Tcherepnin enneatonic. Instead it's the major and minor diatonic (5L2s) and pentatonic (2L3s) scales. Note that the major scale is simply a vertical column of white notes in the Note Lights screen. This applies to all but a few of the smaller edos. Since the 5L2s scale is built into the coloring scheme and is so easy to find, it's rarely listed. Precedence has been given to MOS scales that are harder to find.*

  *Scales can be interesting melodically (MOS), smooth harmonically, or just useful markers. 14edo 7L good markers, poor for condensing*
  *Edos 15-22 and above often have a 12-note scale that can be condensed to a familiar 12-note layout.*

  *The 4 default scales for each edo, along with some interesting possibilities:*
  * *5edo:  1L1s(3:2), 2L1s(2:1)*

  *Default fretboards: The dot patterns tend to follow the conventional m3 P4 P5 M6 P8 guitar fret markers. Some edos add M2 and m7. Edos above 24 approximate 12edo, in other words there are dots about every 100 cents. 41edo is an exception. It has kites like a Kite guitar.*

VERTICAL WICKI-HAYDEN LAYOUT

You can use a chromatically condensed guitar tuning to create a vertical Wicki-Hayden layout. (Playing vertically means rotating the LinnStrument 90 degrees.) The range is huge, almost 8 octaves on a LinnStrument 128!

    *  *  C  D  E  *  *  *      higher
    *  *  F  G  A  B  *  *
    *  *  C  D  E  *  *  *
    *  *  F  G  A  B  *  *
    *  *  C  D  E  *  *  *      lower

* *Set both the column offset and the per-split row offset to OFF*
* *Set the EDO to 12 (not OFF)*
* *Set up one of the first 7 scales to contain only the tonic and the 4th*
* *Switch directly from that scale to the 8th scale and enable the rainbow*
* *Set Condense To Scale to 1*
* *Set the anchor pad to row 3 col 12 (col 8 on a Linn 128) and the anchor note to C3*
* *Set the guitar tuning to -2 between all strings and change DIA to CHRO*
* *Optional: Condense the other split similarly, and in the left split turn off pitch bending, and in the right split turn on pitch quantization*

You'll get a "squared-off" Wicki-Hayden that doesn't drift off sideways. The 7 white keys will be in rows 3-6. The 5 black keys (actually green) will be mostly in the top two rows and the bottom two rows. The row offset will be -2 and the column offset will alternate between +5 and +7. Now rotate the LinnStrument 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the Settings buttons are closest to you and play! Swipe vertically for pitch bends.

  *This layout is not isomorphic but it is dimorphic (two shapes). The restriction of only 3 notes per column becomes only 3 notes per row, much less of an issue.*

  *In 12edo, 10 of the 12 major keys have a compact scale 4 columns wide. But Db major and F# major don't. You can make these 2 keys more usable (and 2 others less usable) by adjusting the anchor cell, or by using alternative layout #1.*

Alternative layouts: 
* To shift the CDE row of white keys right one pad, set the scale to use the 5th not the 4th, and set the anchor pad to row 4 not row 3.
* For a lefthanded layout, either tap Global Settings col 1 row 4 to enter lefthanded mode, or set all guitar tuning row offsets to +2.
* For a clockwise rotation with the 8 settings buttons on the far end, do both of those things. 

MEMORIES (PRESETS)

All of microLinn's settings are stored in the 6 memories. If you load (or import via the clip launcher) a memory that has microLinn turned OFF, the microtonal data will not be altered. And if the column offsets and per-split row offsets are also OFF, they will not be altered either (because the edo often implies certain offsets). This lets you use certain memories to configure your synth-related settings only. Load such memories *after* loading a microtonal memory.

The memory on the bottom row is an exception to this. It *will* alter microtonal data even if it has microLinn turned OFF. You can load this memory to quickly return to 12edo.

The 2nd memory from the bottom emulates the [Kite guitar](https://KiteGuitar.com/). It's 41edo with a row/col offset of (+13 +2), with an alternating-3rds guitar tuning. This layout is both very playable and very well-tuned.

The 3rd memory from the bottom is a 31edo Bosanquet layout, row/col offset of (+3 +5). The guitar tuning is the standard one.

To go beyond 6 memories, use the mini clip-launcher to bulk import memories.

BEYOND EDOS: TUNING TABLE MODE 

Tuning table mode is meant for non-edo tunings such as just intonation or rank-2 temperaments. Tuning table mode is also needed for a polyphonic synth that doesn't have MPE (thus pitch bends on one channel affect notes on other channels), but does allow retuning by other methods. It's also needed for a synth that doesn't respond to pitch bends at all, for example certain piano and organ synths.

Once an edo is selected, the LinnStrument usually outputs standard midi notes with tuning bends, and several edosteps will share the same midi note. But a split that's set to Tuning Table mode outputs edosteps instead. The lower left pad (or the lower right pad if the split is set to lefthanded) is midi note 0. The midi notes for the other pads increase from there according to the split's column and row offsets. Thus each edostep is a unique midi note. Certain synths need this format to play edos. Also, unlike standard midi notes with tuning bends, the resulting midi is easily edited. But the main reason to use Tuninng Table mode is to fine-tune each edostep individually, by loading a tuning table in the form of a scala file into your synth, or by using MTS/ESP, or by running microtonal software such as alt-tuner.

The midi note number each pad outputs is determined entirely by the column and row offsets. In theory, the edo you select doesn't matter. But when the edo is set correctly, transposing works better and the note lights make more sense.

When fine-tuning, each note of an N-note scale is somewhat sharp or flat from N-edo. The LinnStrument doesn't know what those discrepancies are, and thus doesn't know what note to bend to. Thus slides are inconsistent. However this is often only a comma difference even on long slides. You have to bend by ear, just like on a guitar.

  *Example: Suppose you want to use Harry Partch's 43-note JI tuning. Set the edo to 43 and turn on Tuning Table mode. Load the appropriate scala file into your synth. Since the anchor pad and anchor note have no effect in Tuning Table mode, you may need to load a keyboard mapping file (file type .kbm) into your synth as well. This file sets a specific midi note to a specific frequency and another specific midi note to be the first note of your tuning. For example, midi note 69 = A above middle-C might be set to 440hz. But since Harry Partch used G for 1/1, using A for our anchor midi note is not ideal. Since there are 43 notes per octave but only 128 midi notes, we can only get about 3 octaves. Let's center our 3 octaves around middle-C. Set midi note 0 to 98hz, which is the G about 1.5 octaves below middle-C. Set the starting note to midi note 0. (Setting anchor note 43 to 196hz and/or setting the starting note to 43 would work just as well.)*

There are only 128 midi notes. What if your tuning spans more than 128 notes? (For example, 4 octaves of Partch.) One solution is to use splits. Each split has up to 128 notes, so there can be a total of 256 pitches. But you can't slide across the split point. Also a large edo combined with large column and row offsets can actually exceed 256 edosteps. See the next two sections for two other solutions.

  *When tuning table is set to ON (no CCs or rechanneling), all notes above 127 become dead pads.*

TUNING TABLE MODE WITH MIDI GROUPING CCs

When there are more than 128 notes, microLinn assigns the notes to midi groups. There are up to 8 groups of 128 notes each. Group 1 is notes 0-127, group 2 is notes 128-255, etc. A group uses up to 16 midi channels as usual. Thus up to 1024 notes can be sent on any channel.

Your LinnStrument can send a CC message immediately before every note-on indicating the midi group. Your DAW can then use a custom midi-only effect to filter out all but one group. Your DAW would have multiple tracks, each receiving from only one group, and each with one instance of your softsynth into which you have loaded the appropriate scala and kbm files. Thus a tuning that requires N groups would also require N instances of your softsynth.

  *Details: To send grouping CCs, swipe the tuning table mode past "ON" to "CC". You must also select a grouping CC type. (Until you do, "CC" will be displayed in red.) The two splits can send the same CC. See CC SUGGESTIONS above for which CCs to avoid. The filtering effect will filter out the grouping CC, so you needn't worry about it affecting your synth.*

  *The CC value is the midi group number, 1-8. Within a group, midi notes run from 0 to 127. Thus note 128 becomes midi note 0 in group 2. The number of groups needed depends on how many notes your tuning uses. MicroLinn automatically calculates the number of groups and indicates it by a vertical stack of 1-8 dots after the "CC".*

  *See the LinnWiki for microLinnMidiGroupFilter.jsfx, a plug-in for Reaper, and microLinnMidiGroupDemo.RPP, an example Reaper project. Upon receiving a grouping CC, the filtering effect assigns a group (the CC's value) to the CC's channel. It then only passes midi data from those channels that have been assigned to a certain group.*

  *The jsfx filter effect runs natively in Reaper and can run in any Windows DAW using ReaJS, a free jsfx-to-VST wrapper. (Hopefully someone can duplicate this simple effect in Abelton's Max 4 Live, FL Studio's MIDI scripts, Logic's Scripter, Bitwig's Grid, StreamByter (free macOS/iOS AU plugin) and other platforms.)*

  *To duplicate the Reaper project microLinnMidiGroupDemo.RPP in other DAWs, follow these steps:*
  * *In your DAW, create a track named "all groups" that receives midi from the LinnStrument*
  * *Create a track named "group 1" that doesn't receive any midi or audio directly*
  * *Create a send from "all groups" to "group 1", only midi, no audio*
  * *In the "group 1" track, load microLinnMidiGroupFilter.jsfx followed by your softsynth*
  * *In the filter effect, set the grouping CC type to match the LinnStrument aand set the midi group to 1*
  * *In the filter effect, set the 3 midi channel sliders to match the appropriate split in the LinnStrument*
  * *In the softsynth, load a scala file with your tuning (or use mts-esp, alt-tuner, etc.)*
  * *Optionally create a track named "effects" and into it load various audio effects such as reverb*
  * *Create a send from "group 1" to "effects", only audio, no midi*
  * * *This will send the output of all the softsynths into one set of effects, more efficient*
  * * *In Reaper, you can instead position the effects track above the "group 1" track and make it be a folder header*
  * * *In Reaper, DO NOT make the "all groups" track be a folder header, because that will mute all the synths*
  * *Select the "group 1" track and duplicate it, and check that both sends are also duplicated*
  * *Rename the new track "group 2", and in the filter effect set the midi group number to 2*
  * *Repeat as needed, you can have up to 8 midi groups*

  *The sound of the synths are generally set exactly the same. If you need to change any settings, you'll have to carefully duplicate the changes in all instances. You may find it easier to simply delete all but the "group 1" track, make your changes, and then duplicate the "group 1" track repeatedly.*

  *In each synth, you must set the anchor note and frequency appropriately via a .kbm file or somesuch. For example, suppose your LinnStrument is set to 4 octaves of 53edo = 213 notes = 2 midi groups. And suppose you want the lowest note of group 1 to be A1 = midi note 33. That's 3 8ves below A-440, so in the group 1 synth, set midi note 0 (not note 33!) to 55hz. Midi note 53 will be 110hz, note 106 will be 220hz, and note 159 will be 440hz. 159 - 128 = 31, so in the group 2 synth, set midi note 31 to 440hz.*

  *Another example, suppose you want the lowest note of group 2 to be middle-C = midi note 60. In the group 2 synth, set midi note 0 (not note 60!) to 261.63hz. Note 0 in group 2 is really note 128 of the full 213 notes. So an octave below middle-C is 128 - 53 = 75. So in the group 1 synth, set midi note 75 to 130.815hz.*

  *All this assumes your synths are MPE-compatible and can handle midi channels independently. If not, each group synth must be replaced by up to 16 separate synths, each receiving only 1 midi channel.*

  *Grouping CCs are sent before locating CCs, so that locating CCs can be filtered out. Assuming the default 235 microseconds between USB MIDI bytes, sending grouping CCs delays note-ons by 705 microseconds, and sending both grouping and locating CCs delays note-ons by 1.41 milliseconds.*

TUNING TABLE MODE WITH RECHANNELING

Rechanneling indicates the midi group by sending certain midi notes to channels beyond those selected. Like midi grouping CCs, rechanneling requires multiple instances of your synth. Unlike grouping CCs, rechanneling doesn't require Reaper/ReaJS. But it might reduce the number of channels you can use, and hence reduce the polyphony. Only one split can be rechannelled at a time. Often that split will use most or all of the 16 midi channels, thus you might not be able to use a second split at all. Lastly, rechanneling has a maximum of 4 midi groups and 512 notes, not 8 and 1024.

  *Details: Turn on rechanneling by swiping past "CC" to "RCH". This will automatically set the current split to use channel-per-note mode and a certain block of channels. Midi group 1 uses this block, and the other midi groups are sent to other blocks. MicroLinn automatically calculates the number of groups and indicates it by a vertical stack of 1, 2, 3 or 4 dots after the "RCH". (If there are more tha 4 groups, "RCH" will be displayed in red.) In the Per-Split display, the additional midi channel blocks are displayed in the accent color. Beware: make sure the other split doesn't also use these channels!*

  *Your DAW should send each block of channels plus the main channel to a different instance of your synth. See the LinnWiki for midiChannelFilter.jsfx, a plug-in for Reaper, and microLinnRechannelingDemo.RPP, an example Reaper project. In each track, the filter effect only lets certain midi channels thru. (Sysexes and realtime messages are always passed thru.) On each synth instance, set the anchor note and frequency similar to the grouping CCs method.*

  *To duplicate the Reaper project microLinnRechannelingDemo.RPP in other DAWs, follow the steps above for microLinnMidiGroupDemo.RPP. But use midiChannelFilter instead of microLinnMidiGroupFilter, and don't go past group 4.*

  *The jsfx filter effect runs natively in Reaper and can run in any Windows DAW using ReaJS, a free jsfx-to-VST wrapper. If you can't use it, try one of these plug-ins:*
  * *MIDIChFilter (free, Windows VST) https://www.codefn42.com/midichfilter/index.html*

  * *MIDI Polysher (free, Windows/Mac VST) https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/3-Studio-Tools/67-Virtual-Patchbay/909-MIDI-Polysher*
  * *MidiFlow Channels ($2, iOS) https://www.midiflow.com/audiobus/channels/*
  * *Distributor (US$20, VST/AU) https://grumpymonkeyplugins.com/products/distributor*
  *(We have not personally tested these plugins.) Your DAW may also include a native channel filter plugin. In addition, microLinnMidiGroupFilter.jsfx (and any ports of it to other platforms) also serves as a channel filter. As a last resort, try sending midi channels individually. For example, to send channels 1-6 to a track, create a send for channel 1, another send for channel 2, etc.*

  *For the left split,*
  * *Channel 1 is the MPE main channel (the additional channel in the jsfx filter effect).*
  * *For up to 128 notes = 1 group, rechanneling doesn't happen ("RCH" acts the same as "ON").*
  * *For 129-256 notes = 2 groups, midi in group 1 is sent to channels 2-8. Midi in group 2 is sent to channels 9-15. Channel 16 is unused.*
  * *For 257-384 notes = 3 groups, group 1 uses channels 2-6, group 2 uses 7-11 and group 3 uses 12-16.*
  * *For 385-512 notes = 4 groups, group 1 uses channels 1-4 (no Main channel). Group 2 uses 5-8, group 3 uses 9-12, and group 4 uses 13-16.*

  *For the right split,*
  * *Channel 16 is the MPE main channel.*
  * *For 2 groups, midi in group 1 is sent to channels 9-15. Midi in group 2 is sent to channels 2-8. Channel 1 is unused.*
  * *For 3 groups, group 1 uses channels 11-15, group 2 uses 6-10 and group 3 uses 1-5.*
  * *For 4 groups, group 1 uses channels 13-16 (no Main channel). Group 2 uses 9-12, group 3 uses 5-8, and group 4 uses 1-4.*

  *If the left split only uses two groups, channel 16 is free and you can use it for the right split. Furthermore, you can set the rechanneled split to use fewer channels and the blocks will change to match. The channels MUST be a contiguous block going up from 2 or down from 15. Or if there's 4 groups and no Main channel, up from 1 or down from 16. If you have N channels, the 2nd block is N channels higher (or lower for the right split) than the 1st block, the 3rd block is 2xN channels higher/lower, etc. For example, with 2 groups, setting the left split to channels 2-7 (6 channels) makes the 2nd block be 8-13, leaving 3 channels available for the right split. Don't select too many channels (e.g. 2-9), or some pads will be muted.*

NOTES:

To find all changes to the code, search for "microlinn" or "playedBlink" or "patternChain" or "control the sequencer" or "monoFixes"

"Skip-fretting" is a column offset of 2 - each subsequent pad represents every other MIDI note, so note 0 2 4 6 8 ... instead of 0 1 2 3 4. The name is in reference to the microtonal [kite guitar](https://kiteguitar.com/), which obviously uses frets and not keys, but the LinnStrument's rows and columns work just like strings and frets.

Why would you want to skip half the notes? On the kite guitar, strings are 13 steps apart, which you can achieve on the LinnStrument by setting the Row Offset to a custom value of 13 (Global Settings -> Row Offset -> hold down "Octave" to get the hidden menu -> swipe right). Thirteen is an odd number, so that means that if the first row represented the _even_ scale degrees (0 2 4 6 8...), the next row will represent the _odd_ scale degrees (..13 15 17 19 21..)! Thus you actually have access to **all** the midi notes after all, with two neighboring rows filling each other's gaps. 

This is handy, as 41 notes per octave would not otherwise fit on a single row. But with half that, you get at least an octave per row on a 200-pad instrument. Luckily, you typically only want the odds or evens at the same time on the same string/row anyway, as explained on the kite guitar website.

# Kite Guitar Mode
- Enables skip fretting (column offset of 2)
- Enables Custom Row Offset
- Sets the Custom Row Offset to 13 steps (kite tuning)
- Sets `PLAYED` note lighting to `SAME` mode, so you can see which other pads represent the same note as you learn the kite layout (optional)
