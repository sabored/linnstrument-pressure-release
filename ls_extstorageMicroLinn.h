// 72.2 has the same layout as 72.1 (it only renumbered the Transpose switches), so there is no MicroLinnV72_1 namespace
// When the microLinn layout next changes, add the old structs to this file in their own namespace
// When a new official version comes out, say V17, 
//    Merge the official changes into the microLinn version (this will include V16 code)
//    Change all the Vlatest structs from the V16 version to the V17 version
//    Update the ls_extstorage.ino file
