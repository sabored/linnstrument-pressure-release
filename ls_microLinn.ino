/**************************************** MICROLINN ****************************************

Depending on the context, "microLinn" sometimes refers to the entire fork, and sometimes only the microtonal part of it

This fork mostly augments the official code and does not replace it. It mostly only runs if a microLinn feature is turned on
  Exceptions: sequencer next/prev/play/mute, program change messages sent on release not new touch, 16 launching buttons, PCH footswitch, 
  double volume faders, CC faders use 2 colors, doubly-used midi channels warning, per-split midi channel view follows per-split midi mode
The code that actually handles playing in real time is mostly unchanged, so there should be no increases in latency
  Exceptions: condense to scale with variable pitch bend, mono mode, hammer-ons, sweetening

When the user releases a column 0 button, there is about an 1/8 second delay before one can play
When microLinn is on (when the edo is set), there's a slight extra delay of about 8 milliseconds while caculating tuning tables
But getNoteNumber() will use these tables, which might reduce latency while playing

All new functions and almost all new global vars contain "microLinn" in the name, to avoid conflicts with future updates from Roger
A function that starts with "microLinn" is only called locally in this .ino file, e.g. microLinnTriIndex()
But a function that has "microLinn" not at the beginning is called elsewhere, e.g. isMicroLinnOn() (and perhaps called locally too)

The microLinn software version number is the usual 6-digit version number plus our 3-digit number
This is the number that the Global Settings OS VERS button shows, e.g. 234.072.001
The microLinn data structure version number is Device.version (16 as of late 2025) plus an offset of 56, making 72,
plus Device.microLinn.MLversion = 2 (MICROLINN_MLVERSION), making 72.2
This is the number ls_extstorage.ino uses to migrate user settings from one OS version to the next

MicroLinn includes KVR forum member teknico's channel pressure fix, many thanks to him! Search for "teknico" to see his code
Unlike his original modification, microLinn does not maximize the Timbre/Y data (needlessly prevents playing small Y values)
See https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=591770
https://github.com/rogerlinndesign/linnstrument-firmware/compare/master...teknico:linnstrument-firmware:less-jumpy-z-and-y-axes

Device.microLinn.uninstall is never initialized to false, because no matter where we put the initializing code,
  the updater app runs the code and re-initializes the flag to false, thus uninstalling never happens
(However, importing allUserSettings does set it to false, as does updating to microLinn from the official firmware)
Fortunately, the compiler automatically initializes the flag to false
Fortunately, a setting of the flag to true does not persist over power cycles, for some mysterious reason

Misc small bug fixes, not in the readme file, line numbers are for the official 2.3.4 firmware:
  ls_fonts.ino      line 587      "static Character small_Q = { 4,"          4 -> 5
  ls_midi.ino       line 495      add line to listen to main channel when in ChanPerNote mode
                    line 900      "if (inRange(value, 0, 14)) {"             14 -> 15
  ls_settings.ino   line 722      "midiPreset[0] = 0;"                       [0] -> [s]
                    line 2154     "handleNumericDataReleaseCol(true);"       true -> false   (microLinn issue #5)
  midi.md           line 134      NRPN 61, limits should be 0-15, also in the list playedCell is missing
  various files, search for "avoid transposeLights working backwards when lefty"
  various files, search for "doublePerSplit", it now only applies to the octave/transpose display

POSSIBLE MEMORY USAGE OPTIMIZATIONS

  DeviceSettingsV12 = 2204 bytes
  MicroLinnDevice = 4591 bytes
  DeviceSettings  = 7549 bytes, so pre-microLinn it was 2958
  PresetSettings = 400 bytes (Global plus both splits)
  thus the 6 presets will be 2400 bytes
  total is 10349 bytes
  microLinn sizeof(config) = 16564 bytes

reduce Global.mainNotes and Global.accentNotes from [12] to [9] and change from int to short? 
  96 bytes becomes 36 bytes, saves 60 bytes, saves 420 bytes with 6 presets

(Device struct, cut 8 audience messages, saves 248 bytes)
MicroLinnDevice, pack the rainbows array to 4-bit values saves 765 bytes, but don't pack the constant array
Split struct, pack midiChanSet[16] saves 14 bytes, replace all shorts w bytes saves 23 bytes, total is 2 * 37 = 74 bytes x 7 = 518 bytes
Global struct, change shorts to bytes saves 19 bytes x 7 = 133 bytes
MicroLinnGlobal, pack rainbow, saves 27 bytes x 7 = 189 bytes

pack struct SequencerPattern, save 3 bytes = 12 bytes in struct SequencerProject, 12x17 = 204 bytes

some settings on the Global display are actually device settings, not global settings
  these settings are not song-dependent: serialMode, sleepDelay, etc.
  likewise, move some microLinnSplit or microLinnGlobal settings to microLinnDevice, reduces memory use 7:1
  split: defaultLayout, groupingCC

test unninstalling more

In OneChannel mode, with a mono synth, a trill on 2 pads on different rows that have the same midi note creates multiple noteOns 
for the same midi note, followed by a single noteOff for that note. The single noteOff should silence that note, but the SWAM trumpet 
leaves it sounding. So use lastValueMidiNotesOn to count up the noteOns and send a series of matching noteOffs

fix SCL footswitch leaving hanging notes, see how 8VE+ footswitch handles it
  mainstream bug -- play a note, press 8VE+, it goes down not up!

add double-stops, finish pullOffModes

add M/P (Mono/Poly) footswitch? force hammer-ons or double-stops

DOUBLE-STOPS: Hammer-ons change polyphonic to monophonic when on the same row, inside the zone and outside the wait time. 
  Double-stops change monophonic to polyphonic when *not* on the same row, *outside* the zone and *inside* the wait time. 
  Great for fiddle music! (not yet implemented)
  *Details: Double-stops use the same zone and wait settings as hammer-ons. Requires OneChannel mode. The new note is sent to a 
  new midi channel one greater (1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, etc., but 16 -> 15), so you'll need an extra instance of your mono synth. 
  If a 3rd note is played, it takes the place of the note on the nearest row, and as a tiebreaker, nearest in pitch.*

make export #16 allSettings include the current sequencer project, more convenient
  done, needs error checking, needs testing

CC FADERS IMPROVEMENTS
relative mode for CC faders https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=459910 and ls_faders.ino
  tap to set the fader position absolutely on release, swipe starting and ending anywhere to adjust relatively
  swiping X pads right moves the fader position exactly X pads right, swipe from below to max out, swipe from above to turn off
  an unmoving long-press is relative and does nothing
  if two touches at once, a sort of hammer-on/pull-off, the 2nd touch is always absolute
add a panel switch function that enters/exits CC Faders mode
  affects the current split only, unless Both Splits is on
  does it send an all sound off?
  long-pressing the switch is momentary, so if using two hands you can adjust a fader very quickly
  runtime var byte prevSpecialMode[NUMSPLITS] stores what mode to return to
  if pressed when the user is in CC Faders mode, maybe goes to normal mode? or maybe nothing happens?
  what if the user holds a note and then long-presses the footswitch? can they adjust the fader and hear the result immediately?
  what if the user long-presses the footswitch and then manually enters a special mode?
add an option to send CCs to the other split's channels, for side-by-side faders and playing, avoids having to fiddle with the channels
  in Split struct, boolean ccFaders becomes byte containing 2 booleans (so 4 values), ccFaders, useChannelsOfOtherSplit
  so user can set useOtherChannels once and toggle ccFaders repeatedly
  add this to the long-press display that sets CC numbers, maybe on the left, maybe right below the split selector
  a 2x2 square of dots, top row is left/right main colors, bottom row is same, but tapping them toggles them
  normal is indicated by (LR)(LR), R split using L channels is (LR)(LL), both swapped is (LR)(RL)
  does this affect the mini clip launcher's colors or output?
show the number 0-127 in the other split when you touch it, in the played color, using the same font as global tempo
  an unmoving long-press will read it without setting it
  maybe a tap should display the number after release for a half-second
  if you touch two faders at once, what happens?
add marks every 4th pad like the volume fader? using the low row color?
fix linn128 bug: the upper right corner pad sets the CC for fader #8 but doesn't change to the right split
  workaround: the user can exit to the per-split screen and change to the right split there, then re-enter the CC faders screen
volume fader, display the 2 numbers, maybe permanently?
  attempted, see paintVolumeDisplayRow() in obsolete code section, buggy and I'm not sure it's a good idea
volume fader, tap to set, slide to adjust
low row does the same?

maybe CC faders special mode: make vertical faders, slightly glitchy because of the horizontal separator strips
  scale the Y data down from 0..127 to 16*row..16*row+15
  lets you have a split 3 cols wide with 3 8-pad sliders not 8 3-pad sliders
  if the split is more than 8 cols wide, the extra cols are blank
  could also have 2 vertical 4-pad sliders per column
  either way, use alternating colors as before
  if (sensorCol == 25) preSendControlChange(side, 41, 16 * sensorRow + (sensorCell->currentCalibratedY / 16.0), true);

make drum pads work with the arpeggiator
  low row arp sends 5 notes at once, special arp sends the wrong notes
  using getDrumPadMidiNote() doesn't work, because it uses sensorCol and sensorRow, but it does make cool spacey sounds
  set the left split to non-arp and right split to 16th or 32nd note arp, great for fast fills!

maybe make locating CCs enabled/disabled per split without having to change the CC numbers - why add latency unless necessary?
  counterarguement, just turn it on or off in columns 1-16 or 17-25 (but that wouldn't work on a linn128)

Punch -- avoid a sluggish attack, scale the first 50 ms of Z to the velocity, stop scaling if Z > V
  T = time in ms since note-on, Z = (T/50)*Z + (1-T/50)*V, or with wet/dry W = 0..1, W*(T/50)*Z + W*(1-T/50)*V + (1-W)*Z
  code it up in jsfx first for testing, vars are Tmax and W
  OR, layer the sound with a 2nd "clicky" synth that has very fast attack and decay and doesn't listen to Z-data at all

add NRPNs for 5th switch SWITCH_FOOT_B?

make the red dot follow a slide to the next pad, see transferFromSameRowCell() and handleSlideTransferCandidate()
  It already follows if played mode is CELL (starting with firmware 2.1.0)
  editing handleSlideTransferCandidate() to use inRange(playedTouchMode, playedCell, playedBlink) sort of works, 
  but it leaves stray dots behind and the twin dots don't follow

when dotsCarryOver is true, maybe the other split should use the home split's played color?
  highlightPossibleNoteCells() would need another parameter, isCarryOver, to set the color
  https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=591499 discusses a bug in the dots-carry-over workaround

Global.microLinn.fineTune[27]?? is a packed array of nybbles, -8..+7 cents/edosteps, fine-tunes all but the tonic

check that microLinnCalcLowestEdostepEtc() and others take into account condensing

tuning table modes: 55ed(4/3-50c) = 440/3 notes per octave, 1024 total notes means 1024x3/440 = 384/55 = 7 octaves

decide, should tuning table notes be transposable?

after bulk importing, or after unplugging, bend slope is sometimes too big, going to global menu fixes it

when bulk importing/exporting, clear screen and display "IMP" or "EXP"?

make custom light patterns react to transposing the lights? wrap around to fill in the empty area

color-code the menu buttons? makes them more memorable. Per-split can be green & yellow, global can be orange and cyan

low row sustain mode - make it latch on a short press? or on a double-press like the joystick mode? or both?

low row XYZ mode -- add an option to make X be pitch bends, steal from lowRowBend code
  doesn't apply to joystick mode, too inaccurate

MINOR BUGS

import types 9-11: warning excess data
import type 14, 15: various data failures

make full power dim green the same as low power dim green

Panel switches 8VE±, PCH, PRE and MEM aren't true toggles
because when it's on, a long-press turns it off but releasing a long-press doesn't turn it on again

fix bug with anchor row = 0 and guitar tuning, strings preview note are off by one

when showing custom light pattern in 1 split, sometimes its low row spills over into the other split

anchor pad chooser is blank when displaying a custom light pattern, search for bug: doesn't load anything

colorAccent can be set to 0, if user does this my code should use some fixed color

test if changing splits always triggers a calctuning call, if so, just calc the displayed split(s)

implement showCustomLEDs via getCombinedLedData() instead?
see https://github.com/rogerlinndesign/linnstrument-firmware/compare/master...cmhoneycutt343:linnstrument-firmware-chuckb:master
fix custom LED bugs: completelyRefreshLeds, startBufferedLeds, finishBufferedLeds, see paintSequencerDisplay()
  see NRPN 247
  see https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=519090, checkRefreshLedColumn(micros())

test octave up/down footswitches while playing and sliding, does the calcTuning call make it glitchy?
  if so, copy how the original code does transposing

debug same/blink carry over for note-offs, search for resetPossibleNoteCells
same/blink carry over should have OFF, L->R, L<-R and L+R
a dot played on left split and carried over to the right split should use the left color
bug, when in an edo and in lefty mode, the playedSame dots are off
bug, red playedSame dots are wrong when the number of virtual edosteps is > 128, needs the group number
bug, condensing messes up the red dots
bug, sending midi noteOns to the linn lights up the wrong notes if in an edo
try implementing getMicroLinnNoteNumColumn()
try code that mimics receiving a note-on from the DAW from a channel for the other split?

OLD WAY
The colors use the rainbow metaphor, red-yellow-green-blue = sharp-to-flat = supermajor-to-subminor. There's a rainbow of 2nds, a rainbow of 3rds, etc.
* white = 12-edo-ish = 3-limit
* yellow / green = downmajor / upminor =  5-over / 5-under (examples: 5/4 and 5/3 are 5-over, 6/5 and 16/15 are 5-under)
* blue / red = downminor / upmajor = 7-over / 7-under (examples: 7/4 and 7/6 are 7-over, 8/7 and 9/7 are 7-under)
* purple = neutral = 11-over or 11-under (e.g. 11/9 or 12/11) or 13-over or 13-under (e.g. 13/8 or 18/13)
* pink is reserved for C in certain edos
* cyan / orange = a catch-all pair, e.g. 41edo 7/5 and 10/7, cyan is also for "outside" notes aka interordinals e.g. 24edo
* orange is used in 55edo for upmid and downmid notes

POSSIBLE NEW FEATURES

warning: RAM is limited, can cause Arduino IDE triple compile error

col 12) Microtonal scale aka note lights
  col 3, row 6) Fine-tuning editor

col 16) Global microtonal settings
  row 6) Sweetening amount in tenths of cents (OFF, 0.1 to 6.0)
  row 7) Large EDO for fine tuning (OFF, various 56-311, 1200)

low row restrike mode alternates between downstrokes and upstrokes, which delay certain notes, steal from arp code?
  downstroke on touch, upstroke on release? play alternating fingers legato = no upstrokes?
  pads alternate colors, green = downstroke, blue = upstroke?
  speed of the stroke comes from the Y-data?
low row restrike mode has some way of doing palm mutes? (o just let orange tree samples use velocity)
  low-Z on the held notes make short midi notes?
  playing in the crack (off-X) makes a mute?
  pads alternate colors, green = regular, blue = muted?

improve XYZ behavior with Nathan Kopp's code?

qanun-style mandals: set one split to CC faders and set the 1st CC to 129 = MND = mandals
  condense, the faders alter the scale notes by edosteps
  top row = tonic, 2nd row = 2nd, etc., max 8 notes
  write directly to Device.microLinn.scales using microLinnScale array, then call calcCondensedTuning()
  if one scale note is moved to be on top of another, they merge into one
  if one scale note is moved past another, the notes are reordered

Upon receiving a locating CC, the linn colors that pad with the color implied by the CC's channel?
  But what if the locating CCs overlap with the painting CCs 20-25?

https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=596619

turn the sequencer into a midi looper? just needs live input

NRPNs 62/162 (toggle sequencer play) and 66/166 (toggle sequencer mute) could return the current play or mute state
  value = seqState[split].running or value = seqState[split].muted
  but seqState is not a global var, it's local to sequencer.ino

drum pad mode, besides ON and OFF, add MRMB/MRB for marimba mode
  this adds an 8th column and gets the midi notes from the current scale, transposable
  if microLinn is off, the scale starts at lo-C = 48
  if on, it starts at the anchor note (needs to include tuning bends)
  if custom light pattern or if microLinn fretboard, use the previous scale or else the 1st scale
  or make a midi file with 14 NRPNs

hammerons/pulloffs screen, select for each split,
  see colsInRowsTouched[MAXROWS]
  play D C E, lift up E, go to D or C? (closest vs. latest) closest
  play C E D, lift up D, go to E or C? both are equally close (highest vs lowest vs latest) latest
  option to send or not send a new noteon when hammering or pulling off? (guitar = yes, wind instrument = no)
  if new noteOn, send the noteOn on the same channel (same as the current strumming behavior)
  if no new noteOn, send a big pitch bend instead
  thus the cents zone cant't be bigger than the pitchbend range if no new noteOns
  pulloffs: old note's velocity = the new note's velocity or the original old velocity? (pull-off vs lift-off)
  byte pullOffVelocity; 0 = 2nd note's noteOff velocity, 1 = 1st noteOn veloc, 2 = 2nd noteOn veloc, 3 = average them
  make 2 hammer-on zones, one for ascending and one for descending?
    setting downward to 0¢ lets one play two notes by flamming, leading with the higher note
    but flamming leading with the lower note makes a hammer-on

"Love my Linnstrument but one feature missing from seaboard" Roger discusses mono legato

sweeten 41edo: widen 5/4 by shifting the top note up 2¢ and the bottom note down 2¢
  ratios to widen: 5/4 5/3 5/2 10/3 5/1 20/3 10/1     (maybe 15/8 15/4 15/2?)  (maybe 10/7?)
  ratios to narrow: 6/5 8/5 12/5 16/5 24/5 32/5 48/5  (maybe 9/5 18/5 36/5?)   (maybe 7/5?)
  pitch shifts of 2¢ are unnoticeable, worst case is Cv followed by C^m making C and G shift by 4¢, which is OK
  v(vv#5) chord's 3rd is pulled both ways, so no change, even in an add8 voicing that pulls up harder than down
    Struct Pull {boolean sharp, flat;};
    Pull pull[MICROLINN_MAX_EDOSTEPS];
    if (pull[cell].sharp && !pull[cell].flat) sharpen(cell);
    if (pull[cell].flat && !pull[cell].sharp) flatten(cell);
  issues: in dim2 chord or v(b5) chord, 7/5 is 2¢ sharper = 5¢ sharp (add 7/5 to the narrowing list?)
  in a v9 chord, 9th is 2¢ sharper = 3¢ sharp, and in an ^9 chord, root is 3¢ flat (add 9/5 to the narrowing list?)
  in a vM7no3 or vM7(4) chord, the root-5th interval is 2¢ flat (widen 15/8?)
  would 11-limit chords become worse?
   
Large EDO subset of up to 55 notes:
  for an N-note scale, select N notes of small edo = S-edo then select large edo = L-edo, runs 56..311 (or N+1..311?)
  it's a good idea to pad a very uneven scale with a few extra notes, makes bends work better
  byte Global.microLinn.largeEDO, signed char largeEDOoffset[55], short largeEDOscale[55]
  the S-edo scale gets mapped to L-edo by cents
  tap the rainbow enabler button to cycle it to white and enter fine-tuning mode
    cycle gywg means fine-tuning always has the rainbow enabled, cycle gwywg means rainbow can be off
    "col 3, row 2) Rainbow enabler (yellow = ON, green = OFF, white = fine-tune)"
  tap any note and get a big blue number, edosteps in L-edo or cents in JI, swipe it to adjust ±127
  fine-tuning a note sounds the note, the pitch is calced on the spot
  tap the col 12 scales button to get back to the scales screen to tap another note
  if largeEDO is changed, this scale is adjusted to the new large edo by direct scaling
  if S-edo is changed, load L-edo with N evenly spaced notes 
  show largeEDOscale as notes in condensed ups and downs notation (vG = .G, vvG = :G, Gb = G.)
    edostep 0 is named as the 12edo anchor note plus arrows from any transposition (ignore anchor cents?)
    note format: cyan arrows - blue letter - cyan accidentals (no octave number), same font as anchor notes
    arrows/accidentals are a column going up from bottom row or down from top row, right next to the letter
    letters are 6 rows high, so max 5 arrows/accidentals per column (quip & quid!), use multiple cols if needed
    the scale buttons take up 4 cols, so for Linn 128 there's only 12 cols for the note name
    letters are 3-4 cols wide, so room for 8 columns of arrows/accidentals = 36-40 total
      311edo is sharp-30, pentasharp-23, max arrows = max(A1,m2)/2 = up to 3 cols of arrows and 1 col for #/b
      301edo is 28 23, up to 3 cols of arrows and 1 col for #/b
      note name switches from F to F# to Gb following the fewest-arrows rule, in a sharp-5 edo dudsharp beats trup
        in 72edo, vF# not vGb because the note is closer to F than to G
      1200edo shows a 12edo note plus cents, red if negative, F# is 4 cols wide, digits are 3 cols wide + 1 col spacer
      1200edo's black keys are named C# Eb F# Ab Bb, works musically, avoids the too-wide G
  transpose by S-edo edosteps? or L-edo edosteps?
    to transpose in 311edo, 311edo maj 2nd = 53\311, the M2 is divided into 15 small steps (transpose by -7..7 small steps),
    round(53/15) = 4, so transpose by edosteps is really 4 edosteps = 14¢. 1200edo --> 204/15 = 14¢
  if the equave is non-octave, which are the best large edos to use?
    when the edos get huge, any EDONOI becomes an edo with only a few cents of stretch, enter it as such

add new played mode rainbow (RNBW or RNB) that reveals the rainbow color even on the fretboard or custom LED pattern
  or just have it kick in when cell color = off?

when microLinn is installed, move the 16 sequencer projects around so that the row of the 4x4 array doesn't change?
  the uninstall code moves them back?
SEQUENCER PROJECTS LOAD/SAVE SCREEN: When exporting/importing projects to/from your computer, the updater app refers to 
projects by number. These project numbers now run top to bottom, with the top row being 1-4 not 13-16. This is more 
intuitive because it matches how people read, for example how you are reading this very paragraph right now.

TO DECIDE

POSSIBILTIES

Add the ability to set the split point to col 1? enables single-tap mode to switch splits
  settings.ino handleSplitPointNewTouch() comment out first line
  handleControlButtonNewTouch()
    case SPLIT_ROW:  (doubleTap || Global.splitPoint == 1)
    maybe set Global.splitActive == false;

make system reset be a long press not a short press?

make foot switches be momentary on a long press like panel switches are?
  unconventional, would be weird for sustain, but useful for PCH, PRE, MEM, 8VE±

run the arpeggiator and the sequencer both at once, so that the arpeggiator uses the sequencer's rhythm & velocity?

add the existing Y-maximizing option? OFF X Z X+Z Y X+Y Y+Z XYZ (still jumpy when going small-Y to large-Y)
  use averaging instead of maximizing?
  what if user wants to be jumpy?

POSSIBLE PULL REQUESTS (every non-microtonal feature that doesn't require a new user setting, test thoroughly first)
  sequencer: foot pedal fix, pattern-chaining feature, 4x4 array fix
  done: long-press low power affects brightness only
  double volume faders
  add 8VE± footswitch function

note to self: user can enter/exit microLinn only by going to microLinnConfig and changing the edo from 4 
or by loading a preset (directly or via NRPN or by bulk import), the EDO+ and EDO- switches/pedals don't let you enter or exit

note to self: to use multi-channel output with my non-MPE s90es synth, deselect the main channel

Zach says: There were a few guitar solos I was practicing that involve combinations of extremely slow pitch bends combined with 
repeated picking of the note during the bend. I found that setting the low row Bend option in per-split settings was a perfect 
alternative to these situations. You can bend much slower and more smoothly across a smaller interval using the pitch bend row. 
And as long as you continue to hold the pitch bend row, you can release and re-strike your note to sound it at the current bend level.
Also, the restrike feature imitates repeatedly picking a string.

mijiti says: On the SWAM wind instruments, I use the low-row Z for expression and Y for growl, and Y within the note-pads for Formant. 
With the SWAM strings, I use the low row Y for bow position (along the string, towards or away from the bridge) and Z for expression. 
I also use 2 controllers on the left hand split, only 3 cells wide, to control real-time bow pressure and switch "playing mode" 
(pizzicato/bow). I also have harmonics and bow lift mode mapped there but I haven't yet found myself using them.

John Savage says: I use X-axis to modify the sound a number of different ways, but my favourite is to introduce overtones or feedback 
and a little high-pass filtering on long slides. Gives it an electric guitar feel.

pdxindy says: I have a number of percussive presets that have env decay short and release long so if I tap the key it rings out 
but hold it, it is short and muted. Makes for a pleasing playing style. (linn min note length is 35/70ms)

SWAM Viola: https://vi-control.net/community/threads/what-i-would-like-to-see-in-the-audio-modeling-swam-viola-and-cello.169483/
1) vibrato on all notes without any limit or condition
   set the String Model to "Virtual Adaptive" on the Advanced / INSTRUMENT page
2) Automatic adjustment of the bow pressure and bow distance in relation to the bridge so that the sound is always the best possible
   SWAM already does it; for more, set the "Interactive Bow Compensation" all the way right and UNASSIGN the Bow/Pizz Position from Y-data
3) disable scratching on notes, something that bothers me a lot and makes the sound ugly
   keep a Bow Pressure value around 0.5, limit the Velocity (let's say up to 90 / 95, but you need to experiment) using the remapping curve,
   set the Bow Pressure Accent all the way left.
4) transform my viola into a "viola profonda" in G (1 fifth below the viola) and have the sound remain excellent
   you can set SWAM Viola to start from G#, not G, Advanced / INSTRUMENT -> "String Tuning" all the way left
5) Possibility of making the sound extremely soft and dark on the viola, so that it doesn't become shrill
   enable Sordino, act on the EQ on the Timbre / CAPTURE page, enable the Timbral Correction on th Timbre / SOURCE page,

ideas:
in R or L mode, pull-off to closest note, acts more like a guitar string
but in R+L mode, pull-off to latest note in the zone
if you set zone size = ALL, there's only 1 note per string, like ChanPerRow mode and a mono synth w highest note priority
send note-off just after note-on, for single-trigger synths? hard to do
OFF, R, R', L, L', R+L
R  = nearby notes to the left don't sound (priority = highest)
R' = nearby notes to the left do sound (priority = newest)
use midiSendNoteOffForAllTouches() code to find notes in the zone

tests:
slide and then hammer
play C, slide up to D, hammer-on C, release C and D in either order
play C C# D (or B C D) in all 6 orders and release them in all 6 orders:   123 132 213  231 312 321

bugs: 


    // handle taking over an already active touch

IMPORTANT: Later on when you update the OS to a different version, you'll be asked if you want to uninstall microLinn. 
Say no (tap the red button in the middle, turns orange) if you're updating to a newer version of microLinn. This avoids 
needlessly deleting your microtonal user settings. Say yes (tap the blue button on the left, turns light blue) otherwise, 
e.g. if you're going back to an official (non-microtonal) version of the firmware. This does delete your microtonal user 
settings, which is necessary in order to avoid deleting all your other user settings plus your calibration data. 
Once you've decided, tap the green button on the right to continue.
