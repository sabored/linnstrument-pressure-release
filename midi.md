MIDI Control Change input
=========================

If the CC faders are assigned to any other CC numbers than the default 1-8 CC numbers, those will be
used for control change input of the faders. If the CC numbers conflict with internal LinnStrument
features, than the CC faders will take precedence. Exceptions: CC98-101, and CC6 or CC38 when part of an RPN or NRPN.

| CC Number     | Used for
| --------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0             | MicroLinn: Set the active bank for a split, the split is determined by its active MIDI mode channels
| 1-8 (default) | Change the position of the CC faders, the split is determined by its active MIDI mode channels
| 6             | Data entry for RPNs and NRPNs, but if CC6 occurs outside of an RPN/NRPN, it controls a CC fader instead
| 9             | Configure User Firmware X-axis row slide, the channel specifies the row (0: disable, 1: enable)
| 10            | Configure User Firmware X-axis data, the channel specifies the row, default is off (0: disable, 1: enable)
| 11            | Configure User Firmware Y-axis data, the channel specifies the row, default is off (0: disable, 1: enable)
| 12            | Configure User Firmware Z-axis data, the channel specifies the row, default is off (0: disable, 1: enable)
| 13            | Configure User Firmware MIDI decimation rate in milliseconds (minimum 12 ms in low power mode)
| 20            | Column coordinate for cell color change with CC 22 (starts from 0)
| 21            | Row coordinate for cell color change with CC 22 (starts from 0)
| 22            | Change the color of the cell with the provided column and row coordinates see color value table below, 11+: default color
| 23            | Make current custom cell colors persistent as pattern (0-2) 
| 24            | Clear persisted custom cell colors pattern (0-2)
| 25, 26        | MicroLinn duplicates the effect of CCs 20-22 with either CC25 or CC26, 3x faster!
|               | The color is encoded in the midi channel, and the pad location is encoded exactly like locating CCs
| 38            | Data entry for RPNs and NRPNs, but if CC38 occurs outside of an RPN/NRPN, it controls a CC fader instead
| 98-101        | Parameter number of RPNs and NRPNs

RPN / NRPN input
================

NRPN messages are a series of MIDI CC messages that allow changing more parameters than are supported by
the standard MIDI CC message list. LinnStrument always expects an exact series of 6 MIDI CC messages to be
received for setting one NRPN to a different value. The first two select the NRPN parameter number, the
next two set the NRPN parameter value (both MSB and LSB are used), and the last two reset the active NRPN
parameter number. Failure to reset the NPRN parameter number can result in other MIDI input messages to
behave unpredictably.

This is an overview of the NRPN message chain:

```
1011nnnn   01100011 ( 99)  0vvvvvvv         NRPN parameter number MSB CC
1011nnnn   01100010 ( 98)  0vvvvvvv         NRPN parameter number LSB CC
1011nnnn   00000110 (  6)  0vvvvvvv         NRPN parameter value MSB CC
1011nnnn   00100110 ( 38)  0vvvvvvv         NRPN parameter value LSB CC
1011nnnn   01100101 (101)  01111111 (127)   RPN parameter number Reset MSB CC
1011nnnn   01100100 (100)  01111111 (127)   RPN parameter number Reset LSB CC
```

CC98 must be the very next CC message after CC99, likewise for CC38 and CC6, and for CC100 and CC101.
Between the 99/98 pair and the 101/100 pair, multiple 6/38 pairs are allowed.

CC98-101 always select the RPN or NRPN parameter number, even when a split's CC Fader is set to one of them (that fader follows them too).


The following table lists all the RPN input values that LinnStrument understands.

| RPN  | MSB Value | Description
|------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0    | 1-96      | Set pitch bend range for both splits to 1-96 semitones
| 6    | 0-15      | Set up MPE on one split (channel 0 = L, 15 = R) for 1-15 channels, or if value is 0, turn off MPE

NRPN 1200 is for devs writing software on laptops that interact with the LinnStrument. It's used mainly for querying (exporting) via NRPN 299. But if used directly to set the model to Linn128, if debugging is enabled, it makes a Linn200 imitate a Linn128's led displays. Helpful for firmware coders and beta testers who don't own a Linn128.

MicroLinn Bulk Import/Export
============================

MicroLinn bulk importing and exporting uses a NRPN plus polypressure messages: 1010cccc 0nnnnnnn 0vvvvvvv, 18 bits<br>
Linnstrument responds to a NRPN 299 bulk export request with a NRPN 300 header and multiple polypressure messages<br>
Linnstrument responds to a NRPN 300 header by bulk importing data from subsequent polypressure messages

All importing is blocked unless "Allow Importing" is manually turned on. All exporting is always allowed.<br>
Importing is automatically turned off every time the user unplugs the Linnstrument, for security reasons.

bulk export request format:<br>
NRPN 299 = (MSB 2, LSB 43), channel 1, value = 2048 + export type = (MSB 16, LSB 1..20)

bulk export format:<br>
NRPN 300 = (MSB 2, LSB 44), channel 1, value: MSB = export type = 1..20, LSB = current edo if export type = 5..8<br>
Polypressure header, channel 9, value: MSB = Device.version, LSB = Device.microLinn.MLversion<br>
(multiple polypressure data messages on channels 1..4)<br>
Polypressure footer, channel 13, value: MSB = export type = 1..20, LSB = 0<br>
In each polypressure message, the MSB appears as the note number and the LSB appears as the velocity

For the polypressure data messages, channels 2-4 are used to store the 8th bit of each byte:<br>
channel 2 or 4 = add 128 to LSB when importing<br>
channel 3 or 4 = add 128 to MSB when importing
